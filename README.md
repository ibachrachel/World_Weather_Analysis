## Module 6: Using APIs to Visualize Weather Data

# Overview 

Jack, an app developer, wants me to develop my PlanMyTrip app into something more complex. The beta testers have recommended specific changes to really improve the overall useablility of the app. They would like the weather data to include a description when locations are displayed. By using specific input statements, the data can be filtered for the user preferences. These preferences will be based on what weather they would like on their vacations. Once the information is inputted, a list of potential travel destinations will be generated with a list of hotels in the cities found. The beta testers will then be able to pick four cities to create their own travel itinerary. The Google Maps Directions API will be used to create a travel route between the four cities on the itinerary.
